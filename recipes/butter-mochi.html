            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Butter mochi is a hawaiin desert that is both sweet and savory.</p>
            <p>It's thick, soft, and chewy, and is also delicious when served warm with vanilla ice cream.</p>
            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Unslated buttter or vegetable oil, for coating the pan</li>
                <li>1 stick (8 tablespoons) unsalted butter</li>
                <li>1 pound mochiko flour (also known as sweet or glutinous rice flour)</li>
                <li>2 cups granulated sugar</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
                <li>2 cups milk, any fat percentage</li>
                <li>4 large eggs</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
                <li>1 (about 13.5-ounce) can unsweetened coconut milk</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Heat the oven. Arrange a rack in the middle of the oven and heat the oven to 350Â°F. Coat a 9x13-inch baking pan with butter or oil. Melt 1 stick unsalted butter in the microwave or on the stovetop.</li>
                <li>Prepare the dry and wet ingredients. Place 1 pound mochiko, 2 cups granulated sugar, 2 teaspoons baking powder, and 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt in a large bowl and whisk to combine. Place 2 cups milk, 4 large eggs, and 2 teaspoons vanilla extract in a medium bowl and whisk to combine.</li>
                <li>Combine the dry and wet ingredients. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and, with a wooden spoon, stir until well combined. Add the melted butter and 1 can coconut milk and mix until fully incorporated and smooth.</li>
                <li>Pour into the baking pan and top with coconut. Pour the mixture into the prepared pan and rap the pan on the counter a couple of times to bring any air bubbles up to the surface. Evenly sprinkle 1/2 cup shredded coconut on top of the mixture, a handful at a time, being careful not to jiggle the pan too much, as you want the coconut to stay on the top. Then sprinkle on a few pinches of flaky salt, if desired.</li>
                <li>Bake the mochi for about 1 hour. Bake until the mochi is set and golden brown on top, 60 to 70 minutes.</li>
                <li>Cool before cutting and serving. Set the pan on a wire rack and let cool completely, about 1 hour. Slice into rectangles, using a plastic knife to minimize sticking; I cut four columns and five rows to make twenty 2 1/4 by 2 1/2-inch pieces. If the knife seems to be sticking, rub it with a little unsalted butter or neutral oil.</li>
            </ol>
