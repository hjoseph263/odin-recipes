                <li>Tare</li>

            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Two days ahead:</strong> For the dashi, combine kombu and 4 quarts cold water in a large bowl. Cover and let sit att room temperature at least 8 hours and up to 12 hours. for the tare, combine soy sauce, sake, and mirin in a small bowl; cover and chill.</li>
                <li><strong>One day ahead: </strong>Season pork shoulder with salt and pepper. Roll up and tie with kitchen ttwine at 2" intervals. (This helps keep the mea intact while cooking and makes for round, compact slices.)</li>
                <li>Heat oil in a large heavy pot (at least 8 quarts) over medium-high heat Cook pork shoulder, turning, until brown all over, 10–12 minutes. Add chicken, spareribs, scallions, carrots, garlic, ginger, and bonito flakes. Remove kombu from dashi; discard. Add as much kombu dashi as will fit in pot once liquid is boiling (reserve remaining dashi). Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer, skimming the surface occasionally and adding remaining dashi as liquid reduces, until pork shoulder is tender and stock has reduced to about 2 quarts, 2½–3 hours.
